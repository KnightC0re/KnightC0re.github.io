<h1>Hey.</h1>
<p>You can call me Damian.</p>

<h1>What is there to know about me?</h1>
<p>Well, my main contributions would be programming.</p>

<p>Programming is fun, whether if it's a job or just a pastime. I enjoy the process of problem solving, shaping mechanics to create satisfying results.</p>

<p>With my studies in Computer Science and Programming in Games Development, I've had experience with multiple programming languages, being able to adapt to each language quickly as I learn.</p>

<p>I understand the value of teamwork and communication within games dev. I strive to help those around me, giving appropriate feedback and understanding their visions with the development, while also willing to ask for concerns about my work and further tasks that I can contribute.</p>

<p>Outside of my main qualities, I also enjoy composing music and drawing pixel art. These are not my best qualities, but I am willing to adapt and learn.</p>
