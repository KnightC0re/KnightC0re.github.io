<h1>Hey.</h1>
<p>You can call me Damian.</p>

<h2>So what's the deal with me?</h2>
<p>Programming is fun, whether if it's a job or just a pastime. I enjoy the process of problem solving, shaping mechanics to create satisfying results. With my studies in GCSE and A-Level Computer Science, and currently Programming in Games Development, I've had experience with multiple programming languages, including Python, Java and C# in Unity, being able to adapt to each language quickly as I learn.</p>
<p>I understand the value of teamwork and communication within games dev, and I strive to help those around me, giving appropriate feedback and understanding their visions with the development, while also willing to ask for concerns and further tasks that I can contribute.</p>

<p>Uhhh...</p>
<p>Well I do have a list of projects.</p>
