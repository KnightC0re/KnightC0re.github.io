    -(unapplied) vary hitsound volumes to match fluctuating song intensity
    
    <h2>normal</h2>
    -(reopen) 00:50:509 (1,2,3) - 00:56:825 (1,2,3) - etc. stack thing
        -timestamped patterns now have too large 1/2 spacing
        -mod also applies to 01:03:141 (1,2,3) - 01:09:457 (1,2,3) - 

    -01:41:036 (4,1) - 2/1 spacing might be too extreme (ds doubled)
    
    <h2>hard</h2>
    -01:47:351 - should have finish here (according to other diffs)

    <h2>hikan's insane</h2>
    -(reopen) 01:28:404 - still not the biggest fan of the awkward rhythm choice
        -basically 01:28:996 (3,4) - 01:45:772 (1,2) - and 01:47:943 (4,5) - have the same spacing as most 1/2s here
         so it's hard to tell 1/2 and 1/4 apart, most of these being blue ticks also hurts reading
    
    <h2>oko's extra</h2>
    -00:22:384 (1) - nc probably not necessary
    -00:47:351 (9) - nc?
    -00:50:509 - i'm honestly very confused with the nc patterning in this section, can you kinda explain it in the thread
     when you get the chance
    -01:27:861 - break broke if you care xd
    -03:06:496 - snap kiai properly
        -also is it supposed to be short like the other kiais

    -03:09:555 (1) - spinner needs nc???

    &#x2754; -vary hitsound volumes to match fluctuating song intensity

    &#x2714; -02:03:536 - 02:51:693 - 02:54:851 - 03:04:325 - add normal sampleset for snare
    &#x2714; -01:15:772 - add finish here for the cymbal

    <h2>normal</h2>
    &#x2714; -02:47:746 (4,5,6,7,1) - vs 02:48:930 (1,2,3,4) - spacing is visibly doubled here for 1/1 gaps, similar with 02:04:128 (3,4,1,2,3,4) -
        i honestly don't think a normal diff should have this much variation in spacing, to maintain consistency in reading for new players

    &#x2754; -00:50:509 (1,2,3) - 00:56:825 (1,2,3) - etc.
        been called on that before on my normal diffs that these stacks under sliderends might not be the most suitable, since
        the sliderend on default skin obscures the following circles, might make them unreadable, plus the stacks are messed up rn

    &#x2714; -01:41:036 (4,1) - this 2/1 has spacing too similar to a 1/1 gap imo
        -plus i think 01:44:193 (1,2) - this gap is a bit too huge for 1/1
        -03:06:299 (3,1) - this 3/2 gap has a similar issue

    &#x2718; -02:56:036 (1,2,3,4) - i'm worried about the overlap with the sliderend here, could cause reading issues
    <span style="color:tomato">mapper decided to not apply</span>

    <h2>hard</h2>
    &#x2714; -reminder to add hitsounds

    <h2>hikan's insane</h2>
    &#x2714; -reminder to add hitsounds
        -01:40:641 (5) - make sure to unwhistle this first though

    &#x2714; -this diff has different combo colours

    &#x2714; -bump hp up to 5 maybe, 4 is too low per rc guidelines and this would work better with diff progression

    &#x2714; -00:12:614 - the intro section has pretty extreme 1/4 spacing between sliders
        it's pretty noticeable to me cuz the rest of the map uses pretty linear movement between longer sliders
        with 1/4 gaps, but the intro has a lot of large jumps between sliders with 1/4 gaps, giving the intro
        way too much impact for its intensity

    &#x2754; -01:28:404 - this section honestly feels a bit too cursed to read lol
        basically you forgo conventional rhythm choice to make things spicy, problem is you never really built it
        up in the map, so this feels really out of place, i'd personally recommend just using rhythms that prioritize
        red or white ticks to be more conventional
        -01:28:404 (1,2,3,4) - 01:34:720 (1,2,3,4) - kinda awkward active blue tick rhythms, would put the sliders on
         white ticks and add circles on blue ticks when they fit
        -01:31:957 (3,4) - kinda unpredictable 1/2 gap since gaps following a 1/4 slider is usually immediate
        -kinda extends beyond 01:41:036 - as well

    &#x2714; -00:49:720 (2,3,4,5) - could probably build sv up to reflect the crescendo of the drums
    &#x2714; -01:50:411 (7) - i don't think this note necessarily fit your rhythm choice and is kinda place in an awkward spot, could remove

    <h2>-kevincela-'s insane</h2>
    &#x2714; -02:53:322 (1) - missnapped to 1/8 lol
