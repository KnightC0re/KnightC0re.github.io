    <h2>general</h2>
    -(was asked to leave hs outside of top diff be for now)
    &#x2714; -remove unused hs files
    &#x2714; -bg is 1 pixel too wide
    &#x2714; -need preview point
    &#x2714; -fix inconsistent red lines idk who to believe :(
        -also mv is sussing these red lines 01:25:598 - 02:12:931 - 01:57:598 - (the last one it straight up said is illegal)
    &#x2714; -remember to add tags (language/genre/gders/pool) + source

    <h2>normal</h2>
    &#x2714; -hp6 :skull: (guideline is 3-5)
    &#x2714; -some broken ds due to stacks
        --00:34:930 (1,2,3,4) - 00:57:597 (1,2,3,4) - 01:26:931 (3,4,5) - 02:32:097 (2,3,4) - 

    &#x2718; -00:32:597 (5,1,2) - reading path might be scuffed cuz 2 and 5 is closer
        <span style="color:tomato">i think the objects fade fast enough so u dont misread ~ revoh</span>
    &#x2754; -01:09:263 (5) - 01:12:930 (5) - perhaps nc these cuz of metronome shenanigans, these feel like downbeats and feels weird not emphasized
    &#x2714; -01:26:431 (2) - 01:31:764 (2) - etc. these feel weird imo cuz the guitar feels relatively weak with the surrounding noise, the drums seems more
     prominent so i think it might be better to have rhythm on white tick for snare or red tick for kick + guitar (guitar kinda fits on red anyway)
    &#x2714; -02:21:431 (2) - offscreen
    
    <h2>cytusine's hard</h2>
    &#x2714; -00:12:096 (5) - 00:20:096 (5) - 03:06:263 (1) - unsnapped

    <h2>lightin's insane</h2>
    (was wip)

    <h2>wispy's extra</h2>
    &#x2714; -hp might be slightly steep, think it took a good 10 sec to heal from 25% to full
    &#x2754; -02:36:930 (1,2,1,2) - 02:42:264 (1,2,1,2) - a bit diabolical to aim reverses for 5* extra lol
        <span style="color:orange">i want some more opinions on this ngl</span>

    &#x2714; -00:17:764 (3) - offscreen
    &#x2714; -00:59:597 (1,2) - nc odd rhythm?
    &#x2714; -01:38:931 (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3) - bad variety, the entire section pretty much uses doubles so this is very out of left field and confusing to read
    
    <h2>toybot's ex</h2>
    (was wip)

    <h2>Paragon & perdition</h2>
    &#x2754; -02:13:597 (1,1,1,2) - 02:18:931 (1,1,1,2) - 02:24:264 (1,1,1,2) - kinda depends if these gets called out in qa but these seems giga awkward
        -im fine with the 1/3 cuz its in the song but the 1/8 slider gap might be a bit much considering it's spaced?
        <span style="color:orange">idk lol</span>

    &#x2714; -00:22:764 (1) - was this intended to end on a 1/16 tick?
    &#x2714; -02:29:930 (2) - accidental pencilina slider (yknow the p loop thing that was extended from the tangent or whatever, its kinda noticeable)
    &#x2714; -02:37:264 (1) - offscreen
    &#x2714; -02:39:430 (1,1,1) - maybe don't nc all? nc spam stacks was previously used to signal 1/6s
    &#x2714; -02:55:597 (1) - ts is offscreen
        &#x2718; -also might be a pain but since 02:54:930 (1,1,1,1) - is moving to the left, imo this slider snapping towards the right
         is not very intuitive, think i assumed it was gonna go left in two testplays <span style="color:tomato">lazy zzz</span>
    &#x2714; -03:16:930 - two greenlines
