    <h2>general</h2>
    -(was asked to leave hs outside of top diff be for now)
    -remove unused hs files
    -bg is 1 pixel too wide
    -need preview point
    -fix inconsistent red lines idk who to believe :(
        -also mv is sussing these red lines 01:25:598 - 02:12:931 - 01:57:598 - (the last one it straight up said is illegal)
    -remember to add tags (language/genre/gders/pool) + source

    <h2>normal</h2>
    -hp6 :skull: (guideline is 3-5)
    -some broken ds due to stacks
        --00:34:930 (1,2,3,4) - 00:57:597 (1,2,3,4) - 01:26:931 (3,4,5) - 02:32:097 (2,3,4) - 

    -00:32:597 (5,1,2) - reading path might be scuffed cuz 2 and 5 is closer
    -01:09:263 (5) - 01:12:930 (5) - perhaps nc these cuz of metronome shenanigans, these feel like downbeats and feels weird not emphasized
    -01:26:431 (2) - 01:31:764 (2) - etc. these feel weird imo cuz the guitar feels relatively weak with the surrounding noise, the drums seems more
     prominent so i think it might be better to have rhythm on white tick for snare or red tick for kick + guitar (guitar kinda fits on red anyway)
    -02:21:431 (2) - offscreen
    
    <h2>cytusine's hard</h2>
    -00:12:096 (5) - 00:20:096 (5) - 03:06:263 (1) - unsnapped

    <h2>lightin's insane</h2>
    wip

    <h2>wispy's extra</h2>
    -hp might be slightly steep, think it took a good 10 sec to heal from 25% to full
    -02:36:930 (1,2,1,2) - 02:42:264 (1,2,1,2) - a bit diabolical to aim reverses for 5* extra lol

    -00:17:764 (3) - offscreen
    -00:59:597 (1,2) - nc odd rhythm?
    -01:38:931 (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3) - bad variety, the entire section pretty much uses doubles so this is very out of left field and confusing to read
    
    <h2>toybot?</h2>
    wip

    <h2>Paragon & perdition</h2>
    -02:13:597 (1,1,1,2) - 02:18:931 (1,1,1,2) - 02:24:264 (1,1,1,2) - kinda depends if these gets called out in qa but these seems giga awkward
        -im fine with the 1/3 cuz its in the song but the 1/8 slider gap might be a bit much considering it's spaced?

    -00:22:764 (1) - was this intended to end on a 1/16 tick?
    -02:29:930 (2) - accidental pencilina slider (yknow the p loop thing that was extended from the tangent or whatever, its kinda noticeable)
    -02:37:264 (1) - offscreen
    -02:39:430 (1,1,1) - maybe don't nc all? nc spam stacks was previously used to signal 1/6s
    -02:55:597 (1) - ts is offscreen
        -also might be a pain but since 02:54:930 (1,1,1,1) - is moving to the left, imo this slider snapping towards the right
         is not very intuitive, think i assumed it was gonna go left in two testplays
    -03:16:930 - two greenlines
