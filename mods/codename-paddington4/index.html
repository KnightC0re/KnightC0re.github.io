    <h2>general</h2>
    -(was asked to leave hs outside of top diff be for now)
    -remove unused hs files
    -bg is 1 pixel too wide
    -need preview point
    -fix inconsistent red lines idk who to believe :(
        -also mv is sussing these red lines 01:25:598 - 02:12:931 - 01:57:598 - (the last one it straight up said is illegal)
    -remember to add tags (language/genre/gders/pool) + source

    <h2>Paragon & perdition</h2>
    -02:13:597 (1,1,1,2) - 02:18:931 (1,1,1,2) - 02:24:264 (1,1,1,2) - kinda depends if these gets called out in qa but these seems giga awkward
        -im fine with the 1/3 cuz its in the song but the 1/8 slider gap might be a bit much considering it's spaced?

    -00:22:764 (1) - was this intended to end on a 1/16 tick?
    -02:29:930 (2) - accidental pencilina slider (yknow the p loop thing that was extended from the tangent or whatever, its kinda noticeable)
    -02:37:264 (1) - offscreen
    -02:39:430 (1,1,1) - maybe don't nc all? nc spam stacks was previously used to signal 1/6s
    -02:55:597 (1) - ts is offscreen
        -also might be a pain but since 02:54:930 (1,1,1,1) - is moving to the left, imo this slider snapping towards the right
         is not very intuitive, think i assumed it was gonna go left in two testplays
    -03:16:930 - two greenlines
