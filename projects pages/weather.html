<h1>Weather Disasters</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Unity</li>
	<li>Individual University Project</li>
	<li>Development Time: 3 months</li>
</ul>

<p>In an extreme world where weather is constantly changing and hazardous, you have to survive with anyting you can find. You can catch a cold even in light rain, better make an umbrella to keep you safe. The snow could freeze you to death, make sure to gather up some wood for campfire and shovel up you base.</p>
<p>This project was made for the Artificial Intelligence module, where my main focus was adaptive difficulty. However, I would also like to showcase my mechanics.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Difficulty</h2>
<p>get chance weight. calculate. unless weather is normal set a static weight.</p>

<p>the more you have to counter, the more likely it can happen.</p>

<p>you have tools, snowstorm existed.</p>

<p>with a lot of wood, snow weathers are likely to birth.</p>

<p>this algorithm works! programmers hate it! also if happen before lower chance later blah blah</p>

<p>other factors too like time and death, the two best vtubers.</p>

<p>without tools weathers can still occur, low chance tho.</p>

<p>rng happens weeeee.</p>

<h2>Inventory and Crafting</h2>
<p>different things makes you different things.</p>

<p>add and delete thing very easy.</p>

<p>if you have enough the game knows you can craft.</p>

<p>the menu updates when you can do thing.</p>
