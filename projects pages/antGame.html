<p>Ant Game, as you may have already guess, is a game about ants! You play as the lost Anthony, separated from his colony after the ant farm collapsed. Now you have to journey through the treacherous lands of... the garden... to be reunited with your family. Who know what obstacles you will face?</p>

<p>For this project, I have contributed several simple mechanics, such as the basic movement, projectile throwing, interaction and dialogue loading. Some more complex scripts were also written, for example, prediction of physics when throwing and climbing mechanics.</p>
