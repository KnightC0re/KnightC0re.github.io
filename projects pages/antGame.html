<p>Ant Game, as you may have already guess, is a game about ants! You play as the lost Anthony, separated from his colony after the ant farm collapsed. Now you have to journey through the treacherous lands of... the garden... to be reunited with your family. Who know what obstacles you will face?</p>

<p>For this project, I have contributed several simple mechanics, such as the basic movement, projectile throwing, interaction and dialogue loading. Some more complex scripts were also written, for example, prediction of physics when throwing and climbing mechanics.</p>

<h2>Dialogue System</h2>
<p>We used ink unity integration by inkle for the dialogue implementation.</p>

<p>Each character is considered an interactable object, along with grabbable items. As the player interact with them, the game checks the type of object the player interacted with, in this case a character, and loads the dialogue.</p>

<p>Each character has a set of dialogue scripts and cameras to zoom in on. Once interacted the perspective shifts to the camera and the textbox appears.</p>

<p>While in dialogue, the player will click to progress. <i>talking</i> determines if the dialogue is still being printed out, so when set to false, the player will not be able to skip the line, however for the player's convenience, the speed of the dialogue printing will increase when clicked. After the message finished printing, the next line can be loaded.</p>

<p>The camera can also be changed during the dialogue, using Cinemachine functionalities, we can set priorities of the cameras so that the camera we desired could be targeted and used.</p>

<p>Below is a sample script demostrate dialogue loading and camera switching. For the first line the game will turn to camera 2 of the character, then the next line will turn to camera 0.</p>
